# Classmate: The Ultimate Note-Taking Companion for Students

**Classmate** is a powerful, intuitive, and easy-to-use note-taking application designed for students. With its sleek interface and focus on convenience, it allows users to create, save, and access their notes effortlessly—whether on their mobile phones or desktops. Classmate eliminates the need to carry physical notebooks, making it the perfect companion for college and school life.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for the frontend, Java Servlets for the backend, and MySQL for data persistence, Classmate ensures speed, reliability, and scalability. Its responsive design caters to mobile-first users, while automatic data saving ensures no note is ever lost. 

## Why Classmate Stands Out

- **Instant Note Creation**: No setup, no sign-in—just open the app and start taking notes.  
- **Automatic Saving**: Notes are saved in real-time as you stop typing, so you never lose your work.  
- **Completely Shareable**: No authentication required—simply share the note's link with classmates or friends.  
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive for seamless use on mobile devices and desktops.  
- **Rich Note Content**: Add code blocks with syntax highlighting, hyperlinks, text, and more.  
- **Advanced Search**: Quickly find your notes using keywords from the title or content.  

## Features at a Glance
